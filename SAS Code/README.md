<h1><p align="center">Instructions for Running Code in SAS</p></h1>

The SAS programs contained in this folder were originally a single script. To aid readability, I have split this script up into several bitesized SAS programs, so the reader can easily distinguish different analysis steps.

Therefore, it is important to run the SAS programs in the following order to prevent errors:

(1) Read check convert and recode data.sas

(2) Table of Fatality Type given Fatality Location.sas

(3) Bar Chart of Direct & Indirect Injuries.sas

(4) T-Test Property Damage given Tornado Severity.sas

(5) Using SQL to join a new table from detail and ftly tables.sas

(6) Bar chart of weather event impact in 2019.sas

(7) Bar chart of weather event fatalities in 2019.sas

(8) Using SQL to create a new table from ftly_det3 table.sas

(9) Bar chart of weather event impact in states in 2019.sas

(10) Bar chart of weather event fatalities in states in 2019.sas

(11) Table of Frequency and Percentage of different Tornado Types in 2019.sas

(12) Bar chart of damage to property and crops.sas
